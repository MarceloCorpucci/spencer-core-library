Feature: Entity Builder
	As a SDET
	I want to create Domain Entities programmatically
	So I will count with an easy way to manage harness code
	
	There's two types of entities: Enum and Objects
	
	Scenario: User creates a Domain Enum Entity
		Given I decided to create an Enum Entity "BrowserName" with the following values
		* name "CHROME"
		* value "chrome"   
		* attribute "name"
		When I invoke the EntityBuilder object
		Then I should get the Enum code in command line
